OK, Let's start from scratch. Again.

I copy the folder for mint_camera_only before I touched anything
I go to /src/parameters.hpp
	I change HOMEPATH to the place where the latest version is
	I change MAXRETRY to 10 (from 100)
	I change CAM_GRAB_N_PICS to 1 (from -1)
	I change CAM_EXPOSURE to 5 (from 1)
	I save the changes
I go to /src/log.hpp
	I change HD1_PATH to "/home/salo/0.Jose/2.mintguider/0.Versions/2015.04.15/mint_camera_only/log1/"
	I change HD2_PATH to "/home/salo/0.Jose/2.mintguider/0.Versions/2015.04.15/mint_camera_only/log2/"
	I change HD3_PATH to /home/salo/0.Jose/2.mintguider/0.Versions/2015.04.15/mint_camera_only/usb/"
	I save the changes
Try to execute it from shell. Go to the folder and enter "sudo make run"
It runs with error messages
	First, it cannot find the /usb/ folder I indicated to save the 3rd copy of the log. I create it manually to avoid error the next time
	It indicates it tries to set the binning to 2x2 (why)? But does ot succeed 
***Look at the binning thing***
	Error saving the image as a FITS file. It says it cannot create the name. I check that effectively, not FITS file has been saved.
	I think it is because it adds a ! at the beginning of the name (why?)
	I go to /src/main.cpp change the line where the filename is created to eliminate the "!" at the beginning
I try again to execute it from shell. Go to the folder and enter "sudo make run"
	The logs are ok
	Same weird message on binning (and ROI)
	Same problem saving the file
	I go to another version of the file in which this was solved to see the difference
`	It seems that the version in 1.Mint works
I decide to copy this version to my directory as a starting version, instead.
I check the contents of the folder, create the usb folder to save the 3rd copy of the logs. Erase images and old logs....
I do the changes explained above in /src/parameters.hpp and /src/log.hpp
Try to execute it from shell. Go to the folder and enter "sudo make run"
It seems to work without problems
I check the image using SAO9
The image is grey, I don't like it. I open fully the diafragm and repeat. Still, I don't like it. I check what were the parameters in other versions
I change the exposure time to 5 ms and repeat
I close the diaphragm and repeat
500 ms full open lens. Repeat
Again, weird image. I go to a previous version and execute
Something weird about exposure that will be fixed later. I need to start moving forward with my new program.
- Adding a new executable to test guidance
- I add a new .cpp and .hpp files which are z_guide and modify the Makefile to create them
	I create z_guide. The only thing it does is to print a statement
	After some fight, I manage to make it run.
	I start adding functions, first, I want to open the camera and close it.
	For this I add the same dependencies as I had for main in the Makefile
***
	Interestingly when running mint from bin with ./MINT, it cannot even open the camera (core dump)!!!! There is a serious bug there
	For some black magic reason, after starting the terminal it seems it works
- Now I am at a point in which I have the image stored in a pointer. Time to add Matt's functions
- First I need to be able to create a frameblob for the frame I just got from the camera
	- I copy frameblob.hpp, frameblob.cpp, bloblist.h and bloblist.cpp to mint/.../src
	- I #include frameblob.h to zguide.hpp
	- I modify Makefile adding bloblist.o and frameblob.o to the list of dependencies of zguide
