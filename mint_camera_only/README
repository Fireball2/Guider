Rubble's MINT

Created by Lucas Sousa de Oliveira (Summer 2012)

What is MINT?
	This program should control the Rubble experiment, trying to be as fail-proof as possible.

How to run MINT?
	Simply "make run" to start the compilation/execution script. If any file was changed,
the source will be compiled again. If not, the script will verify if there's already an 
instance of the program running and run it if not.

Requirements:
	- Drivers:
		- Galil Tools 1.4.0
		- SISO (for Camera)
		- Menable (for Camera)
